# Hey! I'm Lucas, I'm majoring in biology and my personal goal, in addition to graduation, is to learn Python. 
This is one of the repositories I'm using for training!

This repository contains the solutions I found for the problems proposed on the ROSALIND website (https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/), wich is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.

All solutions are in Python and can be identified by the corresponding problem name in the code file.
